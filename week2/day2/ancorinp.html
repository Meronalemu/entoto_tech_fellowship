<p>      A diode laser uses semiconductor technology that produces coherent projection of light In the visible to infrared range. It uses a light beam With a single wavelength for operation.</br>

       Due to the small size, low power consumption, and cost-effective production of laser diodes have become the most common types of lasers in the world.
</br>
        The applications of laser diodes can be categorized in various ways. Most applications could be served by larger solid-state lasers or optical parametric oscillators, but-the low cost of mass produced  diode lasers makes them essential for mass-market applications.</p>
