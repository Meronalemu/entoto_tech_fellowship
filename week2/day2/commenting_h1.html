<h3>Introduction </h3>
<p>Engines are prime movers that convert the energy of running water, wind and heat into a more useful form of energy.  Since all automobiles use heat energy of the fuel into mechanical energy, we will limit our discussion on heat engines.</br>
Heat engines are of two general types, External Combustion Engines (ECE) and Internal Combustion Engines (ICE).  The word combustion is another term for burning.  Thus an external combustion engine uses energy from fuel burned outside the engine, while internal combustion engine uses energy obtained by burning fuel inside the engine itself.  A steam engine is an example of an external combustion engine. </br> 
In a steam engine the fuel can be burned almost anywhere as long as it turns water into steam, which can be directed into the cylinder.  This is external combustion.  Diesel and gasoline engines are both classified as internal combustion engines.  Here the fuel is taken into the cylinder and burned inside the combustion chamber which is part of the cylinder.</br>
         The engines in automobiles are all internal combustion engines. Internal combustion engines can be of two types, reciprocating and rotary.  The type used in most automobiles is the  reciprocating or piston engine.    In this engine, pistons move up and down, or reciprocate.  The other kind of IC engine is the rotary type, in which rotors rotate or turn.</p>
