<h4>join our group and elevate your Intellect</h4>

<p>Heat engines are of two general types, External Combustion Engines (ECE) and Internal Combustion Engines (ICE).  The word combustion is another term for burning.  Thus an external combustion engine uses energy from fuel burned outside the engine, while internal combustion engine uses energy obtained by burning fuel inside the engine itself.  A steam engine is an example of an external combustion engine. </br> In a steam engine the fuel can be burned almost anywhere as long as it turns water into steam, which can be directed into the cylinder.  This is external combustion. Diesel and gasoline engines are both classified as internal combustion engines.  Here the fuel is taken into the cylinder and burned inside the combustion chamber which is part of the cylinder.</p>
